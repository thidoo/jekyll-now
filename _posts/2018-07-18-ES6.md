title: Some New Features in ES6
---

### `const` and `let` (instead of `var`)

* `const`: immutable
* `let`: mutable
* both are blocked-scope (only available within its scope)

### Arrow functions

```
// ES5
function foo(bar) {
  return 'hello';
}

// ES6
const foo = bar => 'hello';

```
* Looks cleaner and more readable
* Can be used with `map`, `filter`, `reduce` neatly

### Template Literals

```
// ES5
function foo(bar, barr){
  return 'Hello' + bar + '! How about ' + barr + '?';
}

// ES6
const foo = (bar, barr) => 'Hello ${bar}! How about ${barr}';

```

### Default parameters

```
const foo = (bar, barr = 0) => {
  return 'Hello ${bar}! You ate ${barr} apples today!'
} 
```
The above function won't return undefined even if we forget to pass in the value for `barr`

### Array and object destructuring

```
// ES5
var profile = {
  firstName: 'bar', 
  lastName: 'foo', 
  age: 28
}

var firstName = profile.firstName;
var lastName = profile.lastName;
var age = profile.age;

// ES6
const profile = {
  firstName: 'bar', 
  lastName: 'foo', 
  age: 28
}

let {firstName, lastName, age} = profile;

```
* As we can see, we don't have to individually assign variables
* The same rule applies for arrays
* If the assigned variables have different names to the object keys, then we can do:
```
let {firstName, lastName: surname, age} = profile;
```

### Import and export

* ES6 allows for the use of `import` and `export` to enable us to create separate and reusable components
(more contents to come)

### Promises

* `Promise`: an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

* **How to create a promise**:
	
	```
	const examplePromise = ((resolve, reject) => {
	  if (someCondition) {
	    resolve(someValue);
	  }
	  else {
	    reject(someError);
	  }
	})
	```
	* Takes two callback functions (usually called `resolve` and `reject`) that are triggered under different conditions
	* When a promise is resolved, the `resolve` handler will get triggered on `then`
	* When rejected, the `reject` handler will get triggered on `catch`

* **How to consume a returned promise:**
	
	```
	ReturnedPromise.then(onSuccess, onFailure) 
   ReturnedPromise.then(onSuccess).catch(onFailure) // same as above
   ```
* **Chaining:**
	
	```
	doSomething().then(callback).then(callback2);
	```
	* Always returns results in `.then`, otherwise callbacks won't catch the result of a previous promise
	* It's possible to chain **after** a failure

* **Error Propagation:**
	* A promise chain stops if there's an exception, and looks down the chain for catch handlers instead.
		
		```
		doSomething()
		  .then(result1 => blah1(result1))
		  .then(result2 => blah2(result2))
		  .then(result3 => blah3(result3))
		  .catch(onFailure);
		```

### Spread syntax

* Allows an iterable such as:
	* An **array** or **string**: to be expanded in places where 0 or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected
	* An **object**: to be expanded in places where 0 or more key-value pairs are expected

* **Spread in function calls:**
	* Don't have to use `Function.prototype.apply` when wanting to use elements of an array as arguments to a function
	* Pass in as arguments to constructor when calling `new`

* **Spread in array literals:**
	* Example:
	
		```
		var foo = ['b', 'c'];
		var bar = ['a', ...foo, 'd'];
		// ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
		```
		
		```
		// Array concatenation
		var arr1 = [0, 1, 2];
		var arr2 = [3, 4, 5];
		arr1 = [...arr1, ...arr2];
		```
	* Copy an array:
		
		```
		var arr = [1, 2, 3];
		var arr2 = [...arr];
		console.log(arr2);
		// [1, 2, 3]
		```
		However, the references to 1, 2, 3 remain the same...
		
* **Spread in object literals:**
	* Shallow-cloning (like Object.assign)

		```
		let obj1 = {1, 2, 3};
		let obj2 = {...obj1};
		```
	* For deep-cloning (for objects that contain nested objects)
		```
		let deepClone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
		```
* **Rest parameter:**
	* Allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array
	* E.g.
	
		```
		const sum = (...args) => {
		  return args.reduce((prev, curr) => {return prev + curr}); 
		}
		
		console.log(sum(1,2,3));
		// 6
		```
