Java 8 introduced a new functional feature which is the Lambda expression. Read on to learn more about what it is and how it works. 

### JAVA LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS (Java 8)

* Is a function which can be created without belonging to any class
* Can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand

**Matching Lambdas to Interfaces**

* A lambda expression can be used where the type they are matched against is a **single method interface** (also known as *functional interface*)
* Conditions for matching a Java lambda expression:
	* Single method interface
	* Parameter match
	* Return type match

**Lambda Type Inference** 

* The type of the lambda expressions can be inferred from the surrounding code.
	* E.g. From the method declaration right before the lambda expression
	* E.g. From the parameter types

* Sometimes, we'll need to specify the parameter types for a lambda expression if the compiler cannot infer the parameter types from the functional interface method.
	* E.g. (Car car) -> {};

**Lambdas as Objects**

* A Java lambda expression is essentially an object.
* It can be assigned to a variable and passed around, like with any other object.

Another similar feature that Java offers that can get confusing with the Java Lambda expressions is the Java anonymous inner class. Below is a quick recap of what it is.  

### JAVA ANONYMOUS INNER CLASS (Java 7)

* Anonymous inner class: is a class that has no name.
	* Used if you have to override method of class or interface.
	* Used if you need to use a local class only once

**Accessing local variables of the enclosing scope:**

* Anonymous classes have the same access to local variables of the enclosing scope:

	* They have access to members of its enclosing class
	* Cannot access local variables in its enclosing scope that are not declared as ```final``` or effectively final
	* Declaration of a type in an anonymous class shadows any other declarations in the enclosing scope

**Same restrictions as local classes:**

* Cannot declare static initializers or member interfaces in an anonymous class
* Can have static members, provided they are constant variables

**Can declare the following fields in an anonymous class:**

* Fields
* Extra methods
* Instance initilizers
* Local classes

**Cannot declare constructors in an anonymous classs**

-----

**GENERAL RULES:**

* Lambda functions can only be used in cases of single method interfaces. If you need to have classes/methods with more than one method, you need to use anonymous functions.
* The body of a lambda expression does not define a new scope -> its scope is the same as the enclosing scope
* If you find yourself using lambda functions in multiple places, consider creating a class
