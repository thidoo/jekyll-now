It's been a great immersion and learning experience in the first two weeks at MYOB as a graduate developer. 

The first week was orientation week. MYOB ran quite a number of interactive group sessions ranging from sharing information 
about the company to getting the new graduates (or proteges) to be comfortable with being ourselves and with each other as
we continue learning throughout journey here.

The second week started our official Acceleration program, where we are provided with a great pool of resources of many core
topics to learn from. 
  This week I started out by solving the MYOB PaySlip Coding Challenge using Java. At first, I solved it like how I have been
doing it throughout my uni experience. However, we were introduced to the topic of Test Driven Development (TDD), and that was when
I decided to re-did my program from scratch using the TDD approach. I have written a blog on this topic that you can find here.

  I also did quite a number of Git tutorials to familiarise myself with Git commands (on command line), customised my iTerm, 
started reading a book titled [New Programmer's Survival Manual](https://pragprog.com/book/jcdeg/new-programmer-s-survival-manual)

In reflection, I have really enjoyed being able to learn from so many different experienced developers and architects at MYOB.
They have been extremely helpful, friendly and are never hesitant to lend a helping hand. I look forward to continue working
and learning at MYOB!! :D
