Last week, we got the chance to experience our first ever code retreat as a group with Mark Pearl and Elliott Wanless. It was a great learning exercise and I look forward to doing it again in the near future.

**How the Code Retreat was run:**

* Problem to solve: [String Calculator Kata] (https://github.com/xpeppers/string-calculator-kata)
* Pair programming: pair changed for each round
* Each round came with at least one constraint, some are listed below:
	* Strict TDD 
	* No mouse
	* 4-line methods
	* Solve without regex
	* Implement pair programming in the order of: 
		* One person writes the test
		* The other writes the code to pass the test
		* The first person refactors the code
		* Repeat
	* Delete all code at the end of each round

**Learning**

Some of the key takeways from the session:

*Pair Programming*

* Communicate your thinking as you're typing the code so your peer can understand what's going on and gives feedback or contribute to the brainstorming
* Be open to your peer's ideas
* Have the IDE set up and running before starting the exercise!
* Knowing shortcut commands greatly enhances the flow of the session and help make the experience so much more seamless

*Technical*

* It's good to understand the language you use well, as it helps with implementing your idea in code effectively once you've figured out a solution to the problem
* Refactoring after every TDD increment is a great practice to achieve clean code by removing duplications and keeping methods short and focused
